\begin{abstract}
The ontology-lexicon interface has become an important and successful tool for handling problems in NLP (cite, cite, cite). The foundation of these models based on a separation of the ontological and lexical layers by means of the principle of semantics by reference to an ontology in description logics. However, as noted by other authors, the use of first order logic (hence also description logics) is while effective for nouns and verbs breaks down in the case of adjectives. We propose that this is primarily due to a lack of logical expressivity in the ontology. In particular, many adjectives are i) gradable requiring fuzzy or non-monotonic semantics or ii) operator adjectives require second-order logic. We consider  how we can handle the ontology-lexicon interface in the face of these more complex logical formalism, and show how these can be backward engineered into OWL based modelism by means of pseudo-classes, with application to question answering.
