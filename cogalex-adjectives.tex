\begin{abstract}
The treatment of the semantics of adjectives is notoriously challenging, particularly in the context of the so called ontology-lexicon interface which attempts to capture the semantics of words by reference to an ontology in description logics or some other, typically first-order, logical formalism.
The use of first order logic (hence also description logics),
while effective for nouns and verbs, breaks down in the case of adjectives. 
We argue that this is primarily due to a lack of logical expressivity in the 
underlying ontology languages. In particular, beyond the straightforward intersective adjectives, there exist i) \emph{gradable adjectives}, requiring fuzzy or
non-monotonic semantics as well as ii) \emph{operator adjectives}, requiring second-order logic for modelling. 
We consider how we can extend the ontology-lexicon interface as realized by extant models such as lemon in the face of the issues mentioned above, in particular those arising in the context of modelling the ontological semantics of adjectives. We show how more complex logical formalisms required to capture the ontological semantics of adjectives can be backward 
engineered into OWL-based modelling by means of pseudo-classes. We discuss the implications of this modelling in the context of an application to ontology-based question answering.

Ontology-lexicon models, such as \emph{lemon} (Lexicon Model for Ontologies)~
\cite{mccrae2012interchanging}, have become an important model for handling a 
number of tasks in natural language processing. In particular, such 
ontology-lexica are built around the separation of a lexical layer describing 
how a word or phrase acts syntactically and morphologically, and a semantic layer 
describing how the meaning of a word is expressed in a formal logical model, 
such as OWL (Web Ontology Language)~\cite{mcguinness2004owl}. It has been 
shown that this principle known as \emph{semantics by reference}~
\cite{buitelaar2010ontology} is an effective model that can support the task of developing
question answering systems \cite{unger2011pythia} and natural language 
generation \cite{cimiano2013exploiting} over backends based on Semantic Web data models.
The Pythia system, which builds on the lemon formalism to declaratively capture the lexicon-ontology interface, for example, has been instantiated to the case of answering questions from DBpedia \cite{unger2011pythia}
However, as has been 
shown by the Question Answering over Linked Data \cite[QALD]{lopez2013evaluating}
benchmarking campaigns, there are many questions that can be asked over this database that require 
a deeper representation of the semantics of words, adjectives in particular. For example, 
questions such as~\ref{ex:australia} require understanding of the semantics of `high' in a manner that goes beyond the expressivity of OWL. The answer given 
in the QALD dataset for this question is shown in~\ref{ex:australia_query}. 
In particular, the interpretation of this question involves the understanding of 
how the word `high' relates to the property {\tt dbo:elevation}, including ordering 
and subset selection operations, and how to express this semantics in a formal manner.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \begin{enumerate} 
\item What is the highest mountain in Australia? \label{ex:australia}
\item \begin{verbatim}
SELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE { 
  ?uri rdf:type dbo:Mountain . 
  ?uri dbo:locatedInArea res:Australia . 
  ?uri dbo:elevation ?elevation . 
} ORDER BY DESC(?elevation) LIMIT 1
\end{verbatim} 
\label{ex:australia_query}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

It has been claimed that first-order logic and thus by extension description 
logics, such as OWL, ``fail decidedly when it comes to adjectives''
\cite{bankston2003modeling}. In fact, we largely agree that the semantics 
of many adjectives are difficult or impossible to describe in first-order logic. 
However, from the point of view of the ontology-lexicon interface, the logical 
expressivity of the ontology is not a limiting factor. In fact, due to the 
separation of the lexical and ontology layers in a model such as \emph{lemon}, 
it is possible to express the meaning of words without worrying about the 
formalism used in the ontology. To this extent, we will first demonstrate that 
adjectives are in general a case where the use of description logics (DL) breaks down, 
and for which more sophisticated logical formalisms must be applied. We then 
consider to what extent this can be handled in the context of the 
ontology-lexicon, and introduce pseudo-classes, that is OWL classes with 
annotations, which we use to express the semantics of adjectives in a manner
that would allow reasoning with fuzzy, high-order models. To this extent, we base
our models on the previously introduced design patterns~\cite{mccrae2014design}
for modeling ontology-lexica. 
Finally, we show how these semantics can be helpful in practical applications 
of question answering over the DBpedia knowledge base.

\section{Classification of adjectives}

There are a number of classifications of adjectives \cite{}. First we will start 
with the most fundamental distinction between \emph{attributive} versus 
\emph{predicative} usage, that is the use of adjectives in noun phrases 
(``$X$ is a $A~N$'') versus as objects of the copula (``$X$ is $A$''). 
It should be noted that there are many adjectives for which only predicative or 
attributive usage is allowed, as shown in~\ref{ex:clinton} and~\ref{ex:baby}.

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item \begin{enumerate}	
%\item \ \,Clinton is a former president.
%\item $^\ast$Clinton is former.
\item \ \,Mary is a technical engineer. \label{ex:engineer}
\item $^\ast$Mary is technical.
\end{enumerate}
\label{ex:clinton}
\item \begin{enumerate}	
\item \ \,The baby is awake.
\item $^\ast$The awake baby.
\end{enumerate}
\label{ex:baby}
\end{enumerate}

One of the principle classifications of the semantics of adjectives (for example \cite{partee2003there,bouillon1999description,morzycki2013modification}) is based on the meaning of adjective noun compounds relative to the meaning of the words by themselves. This classification is as follows (where $\Rightarrow$ denotes entailment).

\begin{description}
\item[Intersective] ($X\mathrm{~is~a~}A~N \Rightarrow X\mathrm{~is~}A \wedge  X\mathrm{~is~a~}N$) 
Such adjectives work as if they were another noun and indicate that the compound 
noun phrase is a member of both the class of the noun and the class of the 
adjective. For example, in the phrase ``Belgian violinist'' it refers to a 
person in the class intersection $Belgian \sqcap Violinist(X)$, and hence we 
can infer that a ``Belgian violinist'' is a subclass of a ``Belgian''. 

\item[Subsective] ($X\mathrm{~is~a~}A~N \Rightarrow X\mathrm{~is~a~}N$, but $X\mathrm{~is~a~}A~N \not\Rightarrow X\mathrm{~is~}A$) 
Such adjectives acquire their specific meaning in combination with the noun the modify. For example, a ``skilful 
violinist'' is certainly in the class $Violinist(X)$ but the described person is `skilful as a violinist', but not skilful in general, e.g. as a surgeon.

\item[Privative] ($X\mathrm{~is~a~}A~N \not\Rightarrow X\mathrm{~is~a~}N$) 
These adjectives modify the meaning of a noun phrase to create a noun phrase 
that is potentially incompatible with the original meaning. For example, a 
``fake gun'' is not a member of the class of guns.
\end{description}

%This classification is useful, however one further case is important to 
%distinguish and that is of \emph{relational} adjectives\footnote{Which mean in the sense of 
%    expressing a relatioship, as opposed to in the sense of McNally and Boleda~\shortcite{mcnally2004relational}}
%    which have a meaning 
%that expresses a relationship between two individuals or events, for example:
%
%\begin{quote}
%
%He is related to her.
%\end{quote}

Another important distinction is whether adjectives are 
\emph{gradable}, i.e. whether a comparative 
or superlative statement with these adjectives makes sense. For example, adjectives such as 
`big' or `tall' can express relationships such as `$X$ is bigger than $Y$'. 
However it is not possible to say one individual is `more former'. Most gradable 
adjectives are subsective, for example `a big mouse' is not `a big animal'\cite{morzycki2013nonscales}. An 
important group of gradable adjectives are intersective; we call 
such adjectives `absolute' (following \cite{rusiecki1985adjectives}) as they 
refer to an ideal point on some scale For example, a `straight line' is `straight' in 
that it has no bends or kinks. However, we can still talk about a line being 
`straighter' in the sense of closer to the ideal of straightness than some other object

Finally, we consider \emph{operator} or \emph{property-modifying} adjectives, 
which can be considered to be the same as privative adjectives, but in this 
case are understood as operators that change some property in the qualia 
structure of the class. For example, we may express the adjective `former' 
in lambda calculus as a function that takes a class $C$ as input and returns the class 
of entities that were a member of $C$ to some prior time point $t$~\cite{partee2003there}:

$$\lambda C [\lambda x \exists t C(x,t) \cap t < \mathrm{now}]$$

Such adjectives have not only a difference in semantic meaning but can also 
frequently have syntactic impact, for example in adjective ordering 
restrictions, as they may be reordered with only semantic 
impact~\cite{teodorescu2006adjective}, e.g.,

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item \begin{enumerate}
\item \ A big red car.
\item $^?$A red big car.
\end{enumerate} 
\label{ex:car}
\item \begin{enumerate}
\item A famous former actor.
\item A former famous actor.
\end{enumerate}
\label{ex:actor}
\end{enumerate}

One further case that is important to distinguish is that of \emph{relational} adjectives which have a meaning 
that expresses a relationship between two individuals or events, for example:

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item He is related to her.
\item She is similar to her brother. 
\item This is useful for something. 
\end{enumerate}

%Another important distinction to make with adjectives, which is orthogonal to the above classification, 
%is whether they are \emph{gradable}, in that whether it makes semantic senses to make a comparative 
%or superlative statement with these adjectives. For example, adjectives such as 
%`big' or `tall' can express relationships such as `$X$ is bigger than $Y$', 
%however it is not possible to say one individual is `more former'. It should thus be noted that most gradable adjectives are mostly intersective,
%for example a `big mouse' is not a `big animal' \cite{morzycki2013modification}.
%An important group of gradable adjectives are, however, intersective, and we call 
%such adjectives \emph{absolute} (following \cite{rusiecki1985adjectives}) as they 
%refer to an ideal point on some scale, such as `straight', and frequently refer
%to an endpoint of a scale, which Kennedy~\shortcite{kennedy1999scalar} calls
%a \emph{trivial standard}.

\section{Representation of adjectives in the ontology-lexicon interface}

In general it is assumed that adjectives form frames with exactly one argument 
except for extra arguments given by adjuncts, typically prepositional phrases. 
Most adjectives are thus associated with a predicative frame, which much
like the standard noun predicate frame\footnote{$X\text{ is a }N$} is stereotyped in English as:

$$X\mathrm{~is~}A$$

For attributive, usage we associate this with a frame, which is stereotyped as,
where the $N?$ argument is not semantically bound, but instead obtained by
syntactic unification with a noun predicate frame.

$$X\text{ is }A~N?$$

As such, when we encounter the attributive usage of an adjective such as in~\ref{ex:juan}, 
we understand this as the realization of two frames, given in~\ref{ex:juan_frames}.

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item Juan is a Spanish researcher. \label{ex:juan}
\item \begin{enumerate}
\item Juan is a researcher.
\item Juan is a Spanish $?$.
\end{enumerate}
\label{ex:juan_frames}
\end{enumerate}

Note we do not provide modeling for adjectives that are part of a noun phrase,
such as `polar bear', which we would capture as a normal noun phrase with 
meaning \emph{ursus maritimus}.

\subsection{Intersective adjectives} \label{sec:intersectives}

Intersective adjectives are the most straightforward class as in many cases they 
can be modelled essentially as a noun or verb (e.g. deverbal adjectives such as `broken'). Intersective 
adjectives take one argument and can thus be modelled as unary predicates in FOL or classes in OWL as described by McCrae et al. \cite{mccrae2014design}. For practical modeling examples we will use the
\emph{lemon} model as it is the most prominent implementation of the 
ontology-lexicon interface.

The primary mechanism of modelling the syntax-semantics interface in the context 
of \emph{lemon} is by means of assigning a \emph{frame} as a \emph{syntactic 
behaviour} of an entry and giving it \emph{syntactic arguments}, which can then 
be linked to the \emph{lexical sense}, which stands in proxy for a true semantic 
frame in the ontology. For example, the modelling of an adjective such as 
`Belgian' can be achieved as follows (depicted in Figure 
\ref{example-belgian})\footnote{We assume that the namespaces are defined for 
the lexicon as {\tt lexicon}, e.g., \url{http://www.example.org/lexicon}
and for the entry, e.g., {\tt belgian} is \url{http://www.example.org/lexicon/belgian#},
other namespaces are assumed to be as usual.}.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{belgian-example}
\caption{Modelling of an intersective adjective `Belgian' in \emph{lemon}\label{example-belgian}}
\end{figure}

\begin{verbatim}
lexicon:belgian a lemon:LexicalEntry ;
  lemon:canonicalForm belgian:Lemma ;
  lemon:synBehavior   belgian:AttrFrame , 
                      belgian:PredFrame ;
  lemon:sense         belgian:Sense .

belgian:Lemma lemon:writtenRep "Belgian"@eng .

belgian:AttrFrame lexinfo:attributiveArg belgian:AttrSynArg .
belgian:PredFrame lexinfo:copulativeArg  belgian:PredSynArg .

belgian:sense lemon:reference [ a owl:Restriction ;
                                owl:onProperty dbpedia:nationality ;
                                owl:hasValue dbpedia:Belgium ] ;
              lemon:isA belgian:AttrSynArg , belgian:PredSynArg .
\end{verbatim}

Note, that here we use the external vocabulary LexInfo \cite{cimiano2011lexinfo} 
to define the meaning of the arguments of the frame as the \emph{attributive 
argument}, corresponding to the frame stereotype ``A $[attr]$ X'' and the 
\emph{copulative argument} for the frame stereotype ``X is an A''. Furthermore,
the class of Belgians is not named in our reference ontology DBpedia, so we 
introduce an anonymous class with the axiomatization, 
$\exists\,\text{nationality}.\text{Belgium}$. It is in fact common that the 
referent of an adjective is not named in an ontology and as such we tend to 
model denomial adjectives as classes of the form $\exists\,\text{\em prop}.\text{\em Value}$, 
where $\text{\em Value}$ is the reference of the noun from which the adjective is
derived. This modelling is so common that it has already been encoded as two
patterns, called {\tt IntersectiveObjectPropertyAdjective} and {\tt
IntersectiveDatatypePropertyAdjective}, see McCrae and Unger \shortcite{mccrae2014design}.
Similarly, most deverbal adjectives refer to an event, and as such
a common modelling is of the form $\exists\,\text{\em theme}^{-1}.\text{\em EventClass}$, 
for example `vandalized' may be $\exists\,\text{\em theme}^{-1}.\text{\em VandalismEvent}$.

\subsection{Gradable adjectives and relevant observables} \label{sec:gradables}

Gradable adjectives have a number of properties, which differentiate them
from intersective adjectives:

\begin{itemize}
\item They occur in comparative constructions with either `-er' or `more' \cite{kennedy1999scalar}:3), c.f. `*less geological', `*more wooden'.
\item Gradable adjectives have a context-dependent truth-conditional variability, meaning that their positive form is the sum of the relation between the degree of the concept possessed by the object (as measured by the predicate) and the context-dependent standard of comparison based on the same concept \cite{kennedy2007vagueness}. It follows that the properties denoted by adjectives like `expensive' or `small' or `big' vary in intensity according to the context (and time) of use. 
\item They are frequently \emph{fuzzy} (or \emph{vague})~\cite{kennedy2007vagueness}
%\item \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{\textit{absolute} gradable adjectives, like `straight' or `bent' or `red' (to cite your part on colors below), are not vague}}
\item The arguments of gradable adjectives are mapped into abstract representations of measurements or degrees~\cite{kennedy2007vagueness}.
\item There may be a minimum or maximum of this scale, which can be determined
by, for example, whether they can modified by `completely'.
\end{itemize}

As such we define gradable adjectives relative to a particular 
property, these adjectives are also called `observable'~\cite{Bennett06kr}.\footnote{Note in many cases the property is quite abstract such as in 
`breakable'.}, that is it is natural to say that `big' refers to 
`size', however it is clear then that `small' also refers to `size' and as antonyms 
they cannot both refer to the same ontological concept. As such, we introduce 
the concept of \emph{covariance} and \emph{contravariance}, which refers to 
whether the comparative form indicates a higher property value for the subject 
or the object. That is that `big' is covariant with size, as bigger things have 
a higher size value, and `small' is contravariant with size.\footnote{
    The use of these terms is borrowed from type systems, and resembles the concept of `converse observables' as mentioned by (\cite{Bennett06kr}:42). As stated by the author, adjectives often come in pairs of polar opposites (e.\,g. $conv(tall)=short$, and both refer to the same observable (in this case \textit{size}. Some observables analogously hold converse relationships with other observables (e.\,g. $conv(flexibility)=rigidity$ or $conv(tallness)=shortness$).} We also introduce 
a third concept of \emph{absolute gradability}, which states that these objects 
are better described by these adjectives as they approach some ideal value. 
A common example of this is colours, where we may say that some object is 
redder than another if it is closer to some ideal value of red 
(e.g., RGB {\tt 0xff0000}).


While these concepts well handle the comparative usage of adjectives, the 
predicative and superlative usage of adjectives is complicated by three factors
that we will outline below. We notice that gradable classes are not 
crisply defined as with the case of many intersective adjectives, that is that 
while we can clearly define all people in the world as `Belgian' or 
`not Belgian', by who holds a passport of Belgium, it is not easy 
split the world's population into `tall' and `not tall' (This is known as \emph{sorites} paradox \cite{Bennett06kr}).
%, for which many terms and adjectives in natural language are vague given the 
%existence of a specific threshold to relate them to other properties or observables.}} 
In fact, while it may 
be easy to say that someone with height 6'6'' (198cm) is `tall', it is not clear 
whether someone of height 6' (182cm) is `tall', also given that this height should be compared to average (different)
height for a man, or a woman. 
As such, one frequently used way to deal with this class of vague adjectives (and nouns) is via fuzzy logic \cite{Goguen1969,Zadeh1965,Zadeh1975,dubois1988,Bennett06kr}.
Secondly, we note that these class boundaries are 
non-monotonic, that is that with knowledge of more instances of the relative 
class we must revise our class boundaries. This is especially the case for the
superlative as the discovery of a new tallest person in the world would remove 
the existing tallest person in the world from the class of tallest person in the 
world. This non-monotonicity also affects the class boundaries of the gradable 
class itself, for example in the 18th century the average height of a male was 
5'5'' (165cm).\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_height}}
and as such a male of 6' would have been considered clearly to be 
tall. As such, we can conclude that each instance added to our ontology must 
revise the class boundaries of a gradable class, hence leading to the fact that 
gradable adjectives are fundamentally non-monotonic. Finally, we must notice 
that gradability can only be understood relative to the class that we wish to 
grade, that is that while it is unclear as to whether 6' is tall for a male, 
given the current average height of a female of about 5'4'' (162cm) it is clear 
that 6' is tall for a female.

So we can conclude that gradable adjectives are \emph{fuzzy}, \emph{non-monotonic} 
and \emph{context-sensitive}, all of which are incompatible with the description 
logic used by OWL.

\subsubsection{Vagueness}

Currently there are only limited models for representing fuzzy 
logic in the context of the web~\cite{zhao2008uncertainty}. In order to capture the 
properties of gradable adjectives, we introduce a new model, which we name 
\emph{lemonOILS} (The \emph{lemon} Ontology for the Interpretation of Lexical Semantics)
\footnote{\url{http://lemon-model.net/oils}}. This ontology introduces three 
new classes:

\begin{itemize}
	\item {\tt CovariantScalar}, indicating that the adjective is covariant with its bound property
	\item {\tt ContravariantScalar}, indicating that the adjective is contravariant with its bound property
	\item {\tt AbsoluteScalar}, indicating that the property represents similarity to an absolute value
\end{itemize}

In addition, the following properties are introduced to enable the description 
of gradable adjectives. Note, that all of these properties are typed as 
\emph{annotation properties} in the OWL ontology, so that they do not interfere 
with the standard OWL reasoning.

\begin{itemize}
	\item {\tt boundTo} indicates the property that a scalar refers to (e.g., `size' for `big')
	\item {\tt threshold} specifies a sensible minimal value for which the adjective can be said to hold
	\item {\tt degree} is one of {\tt weak}, {\tt medium}, {\tt strong} or {\tt very strong}, corresponding to approximately 50\%, 25\%, 5\% or 1\% of all known individuals
	\item {\tt comparator} indicates an object property that is equivalent to the comparison of the adjective (e.g., an object property {\tt biggerThan} may be considered a comparator for the adjective class {\tt big})
	\item {\tt measure} (TODO)
	\item {\tt defaultValue} (TODO)
\end{itemize}

Using such classes we can capture the semantics of gradable adjectives 
syntactically but not formally within an OWL model, as such we call such 
introduced classes \emph{pseudo-classes}. An example of modelling an adjective 
such as `high' is given below (depicted in Figure \ref{high-example}).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{high-example}
\caption{An example of the modelling of `high' in \emph{lemon}\label{high-example}}
\end{figure}

\begin{verbatim}
lexicon:high a lemon:LexicalEntry ;
  lemon:canonicalForm high:Lemma ;
  lemon:synBehavior high:PredFrame ;
  lemon:sense high:Sense .

high:Lemma lemon:writtenRep "high"@eng .

high:PredFrame lexinfo:copulativeArg high:PredArg .

high:Sense lemon:reference [
    rdfs:subClassOf oils:CovariantScalar ;
    oils:boundTo dbpedia:elevation ;
    oils:degree oils:strong ] ;
  lemon:isA high:PredArg .
\end{verbatim}

As an example of a way in which it would be possible to interpret these 
annotations, we consider Markov Logic~\cite{richardson2006markov}, which is an 
extension of first-order logic in which each clause is given a cost. The process 
of reasoning is thus transformed into an optimization problem of finding the 
extension, which minimizes the summed weight of all violated clauses. As such we
can formulate a gradable adjective based on the number of known instances. 
For example, we can specify `big' w.r.t. \emph{size} for some class $C$ as in~\ref{ex:big}.
%
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item $\forall x \in C, y \in C : size(x) > size(y) \rightarrow big_C(x) : \alpha$ \\
$\forall x \in C, y \in C : size(x) < size(y) \rightarrow \neg big_C(x) : \beta$
\label{ex:big}
\end{enumerate}
%
In this way, the classification of an object into big or small can be defined as follows.
For an individual $x \in C$ the property $big_C(x)$ holds if and only if: 

$$|\{y \in C, size(y) > size(x)\}| \alpha < |\{y \in C, size(y) < size(x)\}| \beta$$

Where the values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are related to the degree defined
in the ontology.

We see that `big' defined in this way has the three properties outlined above: 
it is non-monotonic (in that more individuals may change whether we consider an individual 
to be `big' or not), it is fuzzy (given by the strength of the probability of the proposition $big_C(x)$), 
and it is context-sensitive (as whether an individual counts a big or not depends on the class $C$).

\subsubsection{The supervaluation theory and SUMO}

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Philipp: better integrate SUMO with the rest}}
%%%%% John: these criticisms don't really hold for Markov Logic, I think I remove them
%\textbf{\textcolor{blue}{Despite the successful application of fuzzy logics in the case of lemonOILS, we acknowledge at least two bottlenecks in the use of this kind of logic for modeling vague or gradable adjectives.}}
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{the values which are assigned to the thresholds or degrees to which an object satisfies a vague predicate are assigned \textit{ad hoc}, meaning that there is no objectivity in appointing them.}}
%\item \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{Fuzzy logic is inferentially weak. Its fixed, domain-independent operators do not extensively work for uncertain information as in the case of vague predicates and observables, and could lead to unsatisfied or incorrect inferences (\cite{Elkan94fuzzy2}:5); \cite{Elkan93fuzzy1}.  Given for instance a vague piece of information such as `The mountain is far from the sea; and my house is beside the mountain'' (\cite{Bennett06kr}:36), one can automatically conclude `My house is far from the sea', a kind of inference that fuzzy logic cannot provide. \textcolor{violet}{[John, it would be useful to try to represent this with fuzzy logic operators]}}}
%\end{itemize}


Another way to capture the meaning of these vague terms can be achieved by \textit{supervaluation semantics}. 
Through supervaluation theory, the modeling or positioning of \emph{sorites} vague concepts is grounded in a 
judgement or meaning that lies on arbitrary thresholds, but these thresholds are based on a number of \textit{relevant objective measures} \cite{Bennett06kr}. 
The principle implies (a) that the thresholds used for semantically interdependent concepts 
(let them be predicates or observables) are used consistently (e.\,g. the thresholds for `tall/tallness' 
closely resemble the thresholds for `short/shortness'). It also implies (b) that not only the meaning of 
the gradables, but also the set value of the threshold is context-sensitive.

A recent extension of the SUMO ontology~\cite[Suggested Upper Merged Ontology]{nilespease2001sumo} has add
default measurements for the Artifacts, Devices and Objects enlisted in the ontology (currently amounting to 300+). 
%mentioned in $\diamond$(2) and $\diamond$$\diamond$ have already been contemplated in one recent extension of the SUMO ontology\footnote{The Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO); \cite{nilespease2001sumo}; \url{www.ontologyportal.com}}, namely the addition of defaultMeasurements for the Artifacts, Devices and Objects enlisted in the ontology (currently amounting to 300+). The SUMO ontology can be browsed either via English terms (as derived from the Princeton WordNet \textregistered), or KB terms, where the upper-level concepts have been converted in the formal first-order logic language SUO-KIF.}}
The compilation of defaultMeasurements in SUMO has been just conducted on observables. Given for instance an Artifact such as `Book', the compilation of its default measurements would look like this:

\begin{verbatim}
;;Book
(defaultMinimumHeight Book (MeasureFn 10 Inch))
(defaultMaximumHeight Book (MeasureFn 11 Inch))
(defaultMinimumLength Book (MeasureFn 5.5 Inch))
(defaultMaximumLength Book (MeasureFn 7 Inch))
(defaultMinimumWidth Book (MeasureFn 1.2 Inch))
(defaultMaximumWidth Book (MeasureFn 5.5 Inch))
\end{verbatim}


The example for `Book' shows that the default measurements for the observable reflect a \textit{standard} kind of Book,
i.e., the or one of the most commonly known kinds of the same Artifact. As for the case of `Book', SUMO implies it to be a physical Object with a certain length, height and width. 
A weakness here is that the there is no systematic connection between the {\tt defaultMinimumHeight} and {\tt Height}, since \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{properties like this have solely been defined in SUMO in terms of first-order logic, not in terms of default measurements}}. With lemonOILS we can add this information as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
sumo:Book oils:default [
    oils:defaultFor sumo:height ;
    oils:defaultMin "10in" ;
    oils:defaultMax "11in" ] .
\end{verbatim}

Then if we understand a lexical entry `high' as referring to a scalar covariant pseudo-class for {\tt sumo:height},
it is possible to understand that \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{an}}`high' objects exceeds the default minimum \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{set established for the same and owns at the same time a value for `high' which does not go beyond the established default maximum. The decision to set an arbitrary threshold for objective measures to every specific kind of Artifact enlisted in SUMO presents advantages and disadvantages or bottlenecks. One obvious advantage is that SUMO poses itself, with this further extension on default physical measurements, as the first ontology of its kind to present defaults in correlation with its Artifacts. These approximated values, which ideally should represent the most commonly known form of each of the Artifact, can become handy in need of measurements or further information on the Artifacts. The approximated values also enable to draw a comparison between the children of the same parent. In this way, it might be possible, given for instance the defaults for `Bed', to approximate the defaults for `KingBed', `SingleBed', `SofaBed' `Futon' or `DoubleBed', simply by adding or subtracting height, width, length and weight values with `Bed' as threshold. On the other side though, the SUMO default measurements serve no less and no more the purpose they were originally conceived for, namely to be a reliable (since double-checked), yet arbitrary, approximation of physical measures.}}

\textbf{\textcolor{blue}{A further}} weakness of this approach is captured by the following example:

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
    \item Avery Johnson is a short basketball player. \label{ex:avery}
%\item Michael Jordan is tall. \label{ex:jordan}
%\begin{enumerate}[label=$\diamond$]
%\item \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{The threshold for `height' can either be set (1) with reference to the average height for baseball players, or (2) with reference to the average height for Human, namely Person (where the capital starting letter of the word stands for ontological concept or KB term).}}
%\end{enumerate}
%\item \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{The building is tall. \label{ex:building}}}
%\begin{enumerate}[label=$\diamond$$\diamond$]
%\item \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{The threshold for `height' can either be set with reference to the average height of a specific kind of Building, or with reference to a specific building.}}
%\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

Here, we see the difficulty in interpreting the sentence as Avery Johnson is in fact of average height (5'10'') but
for the class of basketball players he is unusually short. \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{While SUMO has some very specific listings of subsets for the same Artifact (e.\,g. see the subset for `Car')\footnote{`CrewDormCar', `GalleryCar', `MotorRailcar', `FreightCar', `BoxCar', `RefrigeratorCar', `FiveWellStackCar', `FlatCar', `SpineCar', `HydraCushionFreightCar' and more as subsets for for `Car'.} for which it is then relatively simple to define maximum and minimum defaults for each for them and therefore consequently readjust the defaults for `Car' so to be the most prototypical possible, in some other places of its conceptual taxonomy, the ontology is still behind and needs further extension. For instance, with reference to this example of the basketball player, SUMO does not provide a well-structured subset net for Person, which is just enlisted as an ``instance for Human''. Further classifications of `Person' (e.\,g. in terms of gender or age) are still missing.}}\textbf{As such we must introduce default values for
every possible subclass of person. \textcolor{blue}{A way to solve this bottleneck could be to introduce, for every possible subclass of person, default values, as well as to introduce default values for the same Artifact in conjunction with a predicate or adjective. Nevertheless, this can potentially lead}} to an explosion in the amount of information we
need to encode in the ontology.
%, essentially forcing us to encode a class (or default values) for every
%combination of an adjective and a noun. 


%%The observable (hereby as $c$) is therefore treated not as a classical observable (unique in its kind), but rather as an instance of the same ($x$), to which specific (implied) default values are assigned (\textbf{$a$}): \[ [\textbf{a} \circ c](x)\]also representable as \[ \texttt{lsa}(x, \textbf{a}, c).\]}

\subsection{Operator adjectives} \label{sec:operators}

\textbf{\textcolor{blue}{To clarify why we introduce operator and relational adjectives at this point, we might want to tell that these kinds of adjectives are not gradable, but they are usually related to their `classificatory' or `taxonomic' meaning \cite{mcnally2004relational}, which makes them particularly suitable for being modeled in ontologies. Both operator and relational adjectives are characterized by a not-postnominal position (this is why i don't think `known' below is an ok example for relational adjective [we can in fact say `he is known' out of `he is a known actor']), meaning that they cannot be put after the noun.}}

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{Clinton is a male tall former president}} \label{ex:clinton}
\item \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{$ |=  Clinton is president.$}}
\item \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{$ |= Clinton is male $ (male $\Rightarrow$ intersective gradable adjective)}}
\item \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{$ |= Clinton is tall $ (tall $ \Rightarrow$ subsective gradable adjective)}}
\item \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{$\emptyset  \ Clinton \ is \ former.$}} \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{(Since this example was the same as (2a,b) above, I've changed 2(a)(b) into `Mary is a technical engineer $\Rightarrow$ *Mary is technical)}}
\end{enumerate}

Operator adjectives are those that combine to alter the meaning of the adjective itself. 
There are two primary issues with the understanding of the adjective in this manner. 
\textbf{Firstly, the reference of the lexical item does not directly refer to an existing item 
in the ontology, but rather is novel and productive. Secondly, the compositional nature 
of adjective-noun compounds is no longer simple as in the cases of intersective and gradable adjectives.}
To this extent we claim that it is not generally possibly to represent the 
meaning of an operator adjective, within the context of an OWL ontology.
Instead, following Bankston~\cite{bankston2003modeling}, we claim that
the reference of an operator adjective must be a higher order predicate.
If we assume that there are operators of the form of a function, then
the argument of a operator is the attributed noun phrase. As such
we introduce a frame \emph{operator attributive}, that has one argument
which is the noun. The interpretation of a phrase like

\begin{quote}
Obama is the president. Clinton is a former president.
\end{quote}

is understood as:

\[
President(Obama) \sqcap [former(President)](Clinton)
\]

If we understand $President$ as Artifact or Human that has the role of leading a country
(and therefore being true for $Obama$ and $Clinton$), then $former$ creates a new class in the ontology (i.\,e.`FormerPresident') which selects
people who were presidents. \textbf{Thus it
can be said that $[former(President)]$ creates a new class in the ontology.\textcolor{blue}{Just said.}}\footnote{An alternative
    interpretation would be that former modifies the role of Clinton, however this raises the
    question of why the role property of presidents would be selected, and as such
is also unsatisfactory}.
As there is at the moment no agreed representation for such an operator in an
ontology, it underlines the fact that more sophisticated ontology representations than first-order logic are required to understood natural
language in general.

%This means that we must acknowledge operator adjectives in both the lexicon and the ontology. 
%To this extent we define a frame called operator adjective frame, whose prototype is:
%
%$$X\mathrm{~is~a~}A~NP$$
%
%This leads to the odd case that operator adjectives are then considered the 
%head of the frame! \textbf{hmm...} In this case 
%we can understand the reference of the adjective as a property that relates an 
%individual to a class. As such it is clear, that the reference of an operator 
%adjective is a higher-order predicate. Fortunately, in the case of OWL we can 
%cheat on this second-order nature by means of \emph{punning}, which allows a 
%class to also be an individual. If we thus assume that operator adjectives are 
%essentially puns, then it follows that we can assume that the reference of an 
%operator adjective is thus a property. As such, for example, we can model an 
%adjective such as `former' as referring to a property such as {\tt heldRole} 
%whose range is a class of roles punned as individuals. This approach is 
%effective, however it has limits in general \textbf{does it???}
%
%We will not be able to easily create a vocabulary that can fully describe the 
%semantics of the adjective within the context of OWL as the second nature order 
%of the logic cannot be captured well within the framework of description logic. 
%However, we can use the punning trick described above to capture the semantics
%of the adjective. To do this we need to add a frame on the syntax side, that 
%indicates that the argument of the adjective is in fact the noun phrase. We 
%would do this as follows (see also Figure \ref{former-example}):
%
%\begin{figure}
%\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{former-example}
%\caption{An example of modelling `former' in %\emph{lemon}\label{former-example}}
%\end{figure}
%
%\begin{verbatim}
%former: a lemon:LexicalEntry ;

%  
%former:Sense lemon:reference onto:heldRole ;
%  lemon:subjOfProp former:Subject ;
%  lemon:objOfProp former:Object .
%\end{verbatim}
%
%The usage of this frame is intended such that a phrase such as:
%
%\begin{quote}
%Clinton is a former president
%\end{quote}
%
%Is interpreted as:
%
%\begin{verbatim}
%ontology:Clinton ontology:heldRole ontology:President .
%\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Relational adjectives}

\textbf{Relational adjectives are among the simplest and modeled with another frame,
which extends the attributive frame by allowing for a prepositional phrase
adjunct.\textcolor{blue}{Fran: not very clear}} As such we can model `known' with the frame `$X$ is known to $Y$' and
reference {\tt foaf:knows} as:
\textbf{\textcolor{blue}{Another example apart from `known' (that you can use in postnominal position, and therefore does not really represent relational adjective) could be: ``Jemma is a single parent'' $\Rightarrow$ Jemma is a parent, but $\emptyset$ Jemma is single}}


\begin{verbatim}
lexicon:known a lemon:LexicalEntry ;
  lemon:canonicalForm known:Lemma ;
	lemon:sense known:Sense ;
	lemon:synBehavior known:Frame .

known:Lemma lemon:writtenRep "known"@eng .

known:Frame lexinfo:attributeArg known:Subject ;
  lexinfo:prepositionalObject known:Object .

known:Sense lemon:reference foaf:knows ;
  lemon:subjOfProp known:Subject ;
	lemon:objOfProp known:Object .
	
known:Object lemon:marker lexicon:to .
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{\textcolor{blue}{Relational adjectives can also have another definition in literature \cite{morzycki2013nonscales}. They represent a particular class of adjectives that denotes properties of kinds, rather than of simple nouns. In the case for instance of:}}

\begin{enumerate}[resume]

\end{enumerate}

\textbf{\textcolor{blue}{`gastrointestinal' refers to the property of a kind, not an individual. Once again, the interpretation of the adjective is context-sensitive, as clearly showed in the following examples:}}

\item \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{John is an industrial engineer}} \label{ex:industrial}
\item \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{This is an industrial gas turbine}}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Adjectives in question answering}

Of the 150 training and test questions of the QALD-4 benchmark\footnote{\url{http://www.sc.cit-ec.uni-bielefeld.de/qald/}} 
for question answering over linked data, 67 contain adjectives. 
The most common kinds of adjectives among them are intersective and gradable adjectives.

Some of the intersective adjectives do not have a semantic contribution, or at least none that is separable from the noun, 
as exemplified in the noun phrases in \ref{ex:intersectives1} and \ref{ex:intersectives2} (where $|[\cdot|]$ stands for 
`denotes' and the prefixes \texttt{dbo} and \texttt{res} abbreviate the DBpedia namespaces \texttt{http://dbpedia.org/ontology/} 
and \texttt{http://dbpedia.org/resource/}, respectively).
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item \begin{enumerate}
 \item $|[$official website$|]=\texttt{dbo:website}$
 \item $|[$artistic movement$|]=\texttt{dbo:movement}$
 \item $|[$national anthem$|]=\texttt{dbo:anthem}$
 \end{enumerate}
 \label{ex:intersectives1}
\item \begin{enumerate}
 \item $|[$official languages$|]=\texttt{dbo:officialLanguages}$
 \item $|[$military conflicts$|]=\texttt{dbo:battle}$
 \end{enumerate}
 \label{ex:intersectives2}
\end{enumerate}
All other intersective adjectives denote restriction classes that are not explicitely named in DBpedia, 
in correspondence with the modelling proposed in Section~\ref{sec:intersectives} above, for example:
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item \begin{enumerate}
 \item $|[$Danish$|]=\exists\,\texttt{dbo:country}\,.\,\texttt{res:Denmark}$
 \item $|[$female$|]=\exists\,\texttt{dbo:gender}\,.\,\texttt{res:Female}$
 \item $|[$Methodist$|]=\exists\,\texttt{dbo:religion}\,.\,\texttt{res:Methodism}$
 \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

All gradable adjectives that occur in the QALD-4 question set can be captured in terms of \emph{lemonOILS} 
as \texttt{CovariantScalar} (e.g. `high') or \texttt{ContravariantScalar} (e.g. `young'), cf. Section~\ref{sec:gradables} above, 
bound to a DBpedia datatype property (e.g. \texttt{elevation} or \texttt{birthDate}). 
The positive form of those adjectives only occurs in `how' questions, denoting the property they are bound to, for example:
\begin{enumerate}[resume] 
\item \begin{enumerate}
 \item $|[$deep$|]=\texttt{dbo:depth}$ in `How deep is Lake Placid?'
 %\item how heavy (\texttt{dbo:mass})
 \item $|[$tall$|]=\texttt{dbo:height}$ in `How tall is Michael Jordan?'
 %\item how high (\texttt{dbo:elevation})
 \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
The comparative form denotes the property they are bound to together with an aggregation operation, usually a filter 
invoking a comparator that depends on whether the adjective is covariant or contravariant.
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item \begin{enumerate}
 \item $|[$Which mountains are higher than the Nanga Parbat?$|]=$
       \begin{verbatim}
       SELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE { 
        res:Nanga_Parbat dbo:elevation ?x .
        ?uri rdf:type dbo:Mountain .
        ?uri dbo:elevation ?y . 
        FILTER (?y > ?x) 
       }
       \end{verbatim} 
 \item $|[$Was the Cuban Missile Crisis earlier than the Bay of Pigs Invasion?$|]=$ 
       \begin{verbatim}
       ASK WHERE {
        res:Cuban_missile_crisis dbo:date ?x . 
        res:Bay_of_Pigs_Invasion dbo:date ?y . 
        FILTER (?x < ?y) 
       }
       \end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
Finally, the superlative form denotes the property they are bound to together with an aggregation operation, 
usually an ordering with a cut-off of all results except the first one, as expemplified in~\ref{ex:superlative2}. 
The only exception are two cases where the superlative has a semantic contribution that is not separable from the noun, 
see~\ref{ex:superlative1} (where the prefix \texttt{dbp} abbreviates the DBpedia namespace \texttt{http://dbpedia.org/property/}).
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item $|[$What is the longest river?$|]=$
       \begin{verbatim}
       SELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE { 
        ?uri rdf:type dbo:River . 
        ?uri dbo:length ?l . 
       } ORDER BY DESC(?l) OFFSET 0 LIMIT 1 
       \end{verbatim}
\label{ex:superlative2}
\item \begin{enumerate}
\item $|[$highest place$|]=\texttt{dbo:highestPlace}$
\item $|[$lowest rank in the FIFA World Ranking$|]=\texttt{dbp:fifaMin}$
\end{enumerate}
\label{ex:superlative1}
\end{enumerate}

In addition, there is a range of operator adjectives that do not directly refer to an element in the ontology 
(cf. Section~\ref{sec:operators} above). In the QALD-4 question set their meaning is captured in terms 
of SPARQL aggregation operations, as shown in~\ref{ex:operator}. 
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item $|[$What is the most frequent death cause?$|]=$
       \begin{verbatim}
       SELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {
        ?x dbo:deathCause ?uri . 
       } ORDER BY DESC( COUNT(DISTINCT ?uri) ) 
         OFFSET 0 LIMIT 1
       \end{verbatim}
       \label{ex:operator1}
\end{enumerate}

There is only one instance of a privative adjective, used in a context where it does not have a specific semantic contribution:
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item $|[$the former Dutch queen Juliana$|]=\texttt{res:Juliana}$
\end{enumerate}

Similarly, there is only one instance of a subsective adjective, which denotes a property:
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item $|[$professional$|]=\texttt{dbo:occupation}$ (as opposed to, e.g., hobby),\\
       for example $|[$professional surfer$|]=\exists\,\texttt{dbo:occupation}\,.\,\texttt{res:Surfing}$
\end{enumerate}

Finally, there are a few adjectives whose meaning are not subsumed by the canonical modellings as proposed in this paper, 
as they have a highly ontology-specific meaning, for example:
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item \begin{enumerate}
\item $|[$first president of the United States$|]=\exists\,\texttt{dbo:office}\,.\,\text{`1st President of the United States'}$
\item $|[$first season$|]=\exists\,\texttt{dbo:seasonNumber}\,.\,1$
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

% highest population density ?uri dbp:densityrank ?x . } ORDER BY ASC(?x) OFFSET 0 LIMIT 1
% `second' in `the second highest' (\texttt{dbo:elevation} + \texttt{ORDER BY DESC($\cdot$) OFFSET 1 LIMIT 2})

% first album (\texttt{releaseDate} + \texttt{ORDER BY ASC($\cdot$) OFFSET 0 LIMIT 1})
% past two years (\texttt{year} + \texttt{FILTER})
% alive (\texttt{deathDate} + \texttt{FILTER !BOUND})




\section{Related work}

The categorization of adjectives in terms of formal semantics goes back to Montague\shortcite{montague1970english} and Vendler\shortcite{vendler1968adjectives}, however one of the most significant attempts to assign a formal meaning was carried out in the Mikrokosmos project~\cite{raskin1995lexical}. This was one of the first works to treat the case of a micro-theory of adjectives, in which the results were ``machine-tractable'', in that they could be formally defined by a computer. The applications of this were limited however and no formal logic was attached to the semantic representations. Nevertheless much of the modeling resembles ours. In particular, scalar adjectives \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{in the Microkosmos project?}} are modeled by association with an attribute and a range, e.g., `big' is described as being {\tt >0.75} (i.e., 75\% of all known instances) on the {\tt size-attribute}. These classifications do not however clearly separate meaning and syntax and also require a separate modeling of comparatives and class-specific meanings for many adjectives.

Amoia and Garden~\shortcite{amoia2006adjective} handled the problem of adjectives in the context of textual entailment. They analyzed 15 classes that show the subtle interaction between the semantic class (e.g., `privative') and the issues of attributive/predicative use and gradability. 

Abdullah and Frost~\shortcite{abdullah2005adjectives} tackles the privative nature of adjectives by arguing that the adjectives modify the set themselves, in a manner that is naturally second-order. Similarly, Partee~\shortcite{partee2003there} proposed a limited second-order model by means of an `head primary principle' requiring that adjectives are interpreted within their context, \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{here is not clear then what `head' in the principle's name stands for; is it the head noun they are bound to?}}. Bankston's analysis~\shortcite{bankston2003modeling} however shows that the fundamental nature of many adjectives is higher-order, and provides a very sophisticated formal representation framework for this syntactic class.
A more thorough discussion of non-gradable, non-interesective adjectives is given by Morzycki~\shortcite{morzycki2013nonscales}.

The Generative Lexicon~\cite{pustejovsky1991generative} provides another approach to the representation of semantics, and the case of adjectives has also been considered in this context \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{in this context means in the semantics' context presented by Pustejovksy, right?}}. \textbf{Bouillion~\shortcite{bouillon1999adjective} consider the case of the French adjective `vieux' (`old'), which he interprets as selecting two different
elements in the event structure of an attributed noun, that is whether the
state, e.g., being a `mayor' for `mayor', is considered old or the individual
itself. In this way, the introduction of two senses for `vieux' is avoided, 
however it remains unclear if such reasoning introduces more complexity than
the the extra senses.\textcolor{blue}{More than Buillon's study (we could then also cite the German study of \cite{beck2000relational} or the Spanish study of \cite{mcnally2004relational}) we could spend some more words on Pustejovsky. Here what I would suggest:}}

\textbf{\textcolor{blue}{In his analysis of adjectives, Larson \shortcite{larson1998event} suggests that many adjectives denote properties of \textit{events}, rather than of simple heads or nouns (which does not fall very far from the statement, made above, that relational adjectives denote properties of kinds).}}


Peters and Peters~\shortcite{peters2000treatment} provide one of the few other practical reports on modelling adjectives with ontologies, in the context of the SIMPLE lexica. This work is primarily focussed on the categorization of by means of intensional and extensional properties, rather than due to their logical modelling. 

\section{Conclusion}

In this paper we have presented a method for modelling adjectives with the
ontology-lexicon model, \emph{lemon}. In particular, we found that adjectives
frequently go beyond the first-order logic model used by OWL, but instead 
require models that are non-monotonic, fuzzy and second-order. As such, we 
conclude that more sophisticated semantic models are required to represent the semantics
of such words, however the separation of syntax and semantics remains a robust
model, which can easily be adapted to the task of representing adjectives. As 
a final note we consider the claims that not all languages even have adjectives
\footnote{http://linguistlist.org/issues/4/4-442.html} and as such we must wonder to what extent this analysis is applicable
beyond English. We contend, that the underlying semantics of the words we discuss here
is representable in all nearly languages and based on our analysis of realistic
questions as applied in QALD, we believe that this model should be applicable
to a range of domains and languages with little issue, however further 
validation is naturally necessary.
